# Calendar
This is a simple web file created to display Calendar visually using the HTML design. 

The code uses major HTML table and JavaScript Date object
The code is structured in new ES6 class object. 
Have not separated the individual files. Hence, its just a single HTML file with the CSS and JS files included using the style and script tags. 

Have not included comments in the code since the variables and code is simple to understand.
